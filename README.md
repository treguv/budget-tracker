# Budget Tracker

## Purpose

The purpose of this application was to get experience turning an app into a PWA. This is done by implementing offline functionality using IndexDB, a service orker, and a manifest to enable installing. This project is not complete yet. The offline functionality works. The manifest is present but is not allowing me to download it for some reason. And the servive worker is currently MIA.

## Built With

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB / Mongoose
